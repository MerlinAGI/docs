### Method 1: API key

1. Please contact support@listenlabs.ai to request an API key.
2. Use it in your request as in the `x-api-key` header.

```bash
'x-api-key': 'abc123....'
```

Note that this method currently only supports the `/get_responses` endpoint.

### Method 2: Google Id Token

This method is only possible if your account uses signin with Google (OAuth2). In that case, use set the `x-id` header to a valid _id_token_ from your Google account.

```bash
'x-id': 'eyJh....'
```
